1. Why conditional input demand? 
   1. When input prices have low variability. Conditional factor demand can be estimated without information on input prices.
   2. We need to observe all outputs (which is our case).
2. Why not production function?
   1. We need to find a way to aggregate the output.  
   2. We need to observe all inputs. Capital is not easily observed.
3. Are the $\theta_i$ independent of each other? Yes, they are drawn independently from a distribution $G$.
4. The estimate of $\hat{\theta}_i$, the correlation between each other i 
5. You can just regress $\log(x_it)$ on the fixed effect!!!
